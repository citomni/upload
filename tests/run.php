/*
 * Run every suite under tests/, each in its own PHP process: first the isolated
 * suites (tests/<suite>/run.php), then the database suites (tests/<suite>/database.php).
 *
 * Suites replace framework classes with class_alias doubles and install their
 * own error handlers, so they never share a process. Each suite's output is
 * passed through unchanged under a "== <suite>/<script>" heading, which is also
 * the path for running that suite alone. The last line, under "== total", adds
 * up the suites' totals.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   php tests/run.php
 *   php tests/storage/run.php          (one suite alone)
 *
 * Notes:
 * - Suites run with the same PHP binary and php.ini as this script, and with -n
 *   when this script runs with -n. -d settings are not passed on.
 * - Environment variables such as CITOMNI_TEST_PARALLEL and CITOMNI_TEST_PASSWORD
 *   reach the suites, because child processes inherit the environment.
 * - Database suites need the test database server. Nothing is skipped when it is
 *   down; those suites fail.
 * - A suite counts as one failure when it exits non-zero with no failed checks,
 *   or when its last line is not a summary (for example after a fatal error).
