/**
 * Declare this provider package's boot contributions.
 *
 * CitOmni reads these constants when composing the active HTTP or CLI app.
 * All supported contribution constants are documented below but intentionally
 * left undeclared. Uncomment only those the concrete package actually needs.
 *
 * Behavior:
 * - MAP_COMMON contributes services shared by HTTP and CLI.
 * - MAP_HTTP and MAP_CLI contribute mode-specific services.
 * - CFG_COMMON contributes configuration shared by HTTP and CLI.
 * - CFG_HTTP and CFG_CLI contribute mode-specific configuration.
 * - ROUTES_HTTP contributes HTTP dispatch entries.
 * - COMMANDS_CLI contributes CLI dispatch entries.
 *
 * Notes:
 * - Service definitions may be an FQCN string or an array containing "class"
 *   and optional "options".
 * - Within one provider, mode-specific service definitions override shared
 *   service definitions with the same service ID.
 * - Within one provider, mode-specific configuration is merged after shared
 *   configuration, so mode-specific values win on conflicting associative keys.
 * - HTTP routes and CLI commands are dispatch maps, not configuration values.
 * - Keep SQL in Repositories and transport concerns in Controllers or Commands.
